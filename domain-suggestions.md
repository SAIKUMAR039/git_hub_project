## Custom Vercel Deployment
If you deploy your frontend on Vercel, you'll get a free subdomain like:
- gitfinder-app.vercel.app

You can then connect your purchased domain to the Vercel deployment.

## Setup Instructions
Once you've chosen a domain name and purchased it, you'll need to:

1. Add the domain in your Vercel project settings
2. Configure DNS settings at your domain registrar
3. Verify domain ownership
4. Update your frontend code to use the new domain
5. Update CORS settings in your backend to allow requests from the new domain

## Domain Branding Consideration
The domain name should align with your application's branding. Based on your current app name "GitFinder", domains like gitfinder.dev or gitfinder.app would be most consistent with your branding.
